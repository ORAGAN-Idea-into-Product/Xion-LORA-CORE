Getting Started
Prerequisites
Hardware:

LoRa ESP32 Development Board

Micro USB cable for programming/power

(Optional) External 7–12V power supply (DC barrel jack or VIN pin)

(Optional) MicroSD card for logging

Software:

Arduino IDE with the ESP32 core installed, or ESP-IDF for advanced users.

Required libraries:

SPI

Wire

SD

LoRa (optional, for high-level API)

Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LoRa-ESP32-DevBoard.git
cd LoRa-ESP32-DevBoard
Open the example sketches in the examples/ folder with the Arduino IDE.

Select the correct board settings for your ESP32 module and the appropriate COM port.

Upload the sketch to the board.

Usage Examples
LoRa Communication
The LoRa_SendReceive.ino example demonstrates how to initialize the LoRa module, send a simple message, and receive data. It includes low-level SPI functions as well as usage with the Arduino LoRa library.

SD Card Logging
The SD_DataLogging.ino example shows how to initialize the SD card, write sensor data to a file, and then read the data back to the Serial Monitor. This is useful for offline data storage and backup.

I²C I/O Expander Control
The I2C_Expander_Control.ino sketch demonstrates how to use the PCF8574 expander to control peripherals such as LEDs and a buzzer. You can toggle the buzzer on/off by sending serial commands.

Firmware Overview
The firmware is designed to be modular and easy to modify:

LoRa SPI Functions: Low-level functions for reading from and writing to the LoRa RA-02 module.

I²C Functions: Functions to interface with the PCF8574 I/O expander.

SD Card Functions: Basic file handling for logging data.

Interrupt and Serial Event Handling: Examples of how to use hardware interrupts for responsive designs and serial events for user interaction.

Refer to the src/ folder for source files, and check out the inline comments for detailed explanations of each function.
